#Known Issues

BIDS validator warns that some stimuli files are not included in events.tsv. This is due to listing stimuli as A_stim and B_stim in events.tsv files as each trial contained two stimuli. All stimuli were confirmed to exist and be used in events.tsv files using stim_checking.py located in the code/ directory.
